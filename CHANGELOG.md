# Changelog

All notable changes to Chiaro are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

`release.yml` reads the section whose heading matches the tag being pushed and uses it
as the body of the GitHub Release, so a version's entry is written **before** its tag,
and kept to what somebody arriving at that page wants to read.

1.0.0 had no release before it, so its entry-by-entry development record is its own
document: [docs/CHANGELOG-1.0.0.md](./docs/CHANGELOG-1.0.0.md). From 1.1.0 on, version
sections are a normal size and live here alone.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-01

**A clearer page, and an app that reads the forecast itself.** Each hour's icon and word now
come from Chiaro's own reading of the forecast's numbers, every screen has been redrawn, and
alerts, widgets and notifications do more with less noise.

Android 13 (API 33) or newer. Installs over 1.0.0 and keeps your places, alerts and settings.
Check the download with the `.sha256` file beside the APK, and the signing certificate against
the fingerprint in the
[README](https://github.com/fiorenzobrioni/chiaro#install).

### New

- **The forecast, read by Chiaro.** An hour's icon and word come from the rain, snow, chance,
  temperature, visibility and clouds; the numbers on screen stay the model's.
- **How much, not only how likely.** Today's rain and snow in millimetres, the cloud layer,
  and each day's rain, gusts and UV when you open it.
- **Your alerts' hours.** Any time, only in daylight, or one or two bands of your own.
- **A «New alert» card** to start from scratch, a «Serious heat» idea, and new things to watch
  (today's rain and snow, gusts, the European air index).
- **Journal: how the forecast did**, on the days already over.
- **Notifications with pictures**: the next hours of rain, the day's temperature, the warning
  levels. Quiet from 22:00 to 7:00, except red warnings and sky reminders.
- **«In words» shows the next hours** on a tall card, and every widget's settings show the
  card itself at its real size.
- **A new app icon**: the day in a ring.

### Changed

- **Today, redrawn.** The ribbon as light, the sun and moon in the sky, the next hours as a
  curve, the temperature in whole degrees, the forecast for now when the data is old.
- **Sky, redrawn.** Tonight as a night sky, the moments grouped by day with a countdown.
- **Alerts and Journal, lighter to read**, and Settings with a live preview of the appearance.
- **The hours mean the hour that starts.** «15 · 60%» is the chance from 15 to 16.
- **Air quality on the European scale in Europe**, and pollen on each species' own scale.
- **Fewer false alarms.** A storm with under 20% chance no longer raises «Bad weather»; rain
  is announced once per spell.
- **Back follows your finger**, with a preview of the page behind it.

### Fixed

- «In words» no longer drops its temperature on days with a warning, or cuts its last line.
- An overcast sun no longer looks like the moon.
- The week's word follows the day, not its single worst hour.
- A forecast without UV no longer empties the app.
- A rule about today no longer fires twice a day.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-21

**The first release.** Chiaro answers the question people actually have: is it worth
going outside, and when. A computed sky as the hero, one sentence before any number, an
agenda of the day's sun and sky with a verdict on each moment, a journal of how the
forecast changed, and alerts the reader writes themselves. Free, no account, no ads, no
tracking, no API key.

Android 13 (API 33) or newer. The APK on this page is minified and signed with the
release key; `mapping.txt` beside it is what makes a stack trace from it readable.

### What is in it

- **Today** — one scroll that starts with a **computed sky**: a gradient built from the real
  position of the sun, the cloud cover and the moon, carrying the place, the temperature and
  the **headline sentence** ("umbrella around 17:00, clearing after 19:00"), which is absent
  when there is nothing worth saying. Under it the next 24 hours with a rain sparkline, the
  rest of the day as one merged timeline of sun, moon and weather turns, what changed when
  the last update moved the week, the seven days on one shared temperature scale, and a
  details grid where every number carries its consequence: UV 8 is "burns in about 15
  minutes, cover up", not an 8.
- **Sky** — tonight's verdict on the dark window with the numbers that decided it, the
  moments ahead as an agenda rather than a log, the calendar of what is coming (meteor peaks,
  the next full moon, solstices and equinoxes) with an honest "too far out to say" past the
  forecast's horizon, and a catalog of **60 moments** in seven groups, each teaching what it
  is in one line. Nine carry a camera and a direction to look in. All computed on the device,
  with no network at all.
- **Sky reminders** — a bell on any moment, delivered by a single deliberately inexact alarm
  (15 minute floor, no exact-alarm permission asked), re-armed on boot, and suppressed when
  the sky is going to hide the event unless you ask for it anyway.
- **Official warnings** — in Italy, the Protezione Civile's criticality bulletin. The 187
  zones are bundled as geometry, so a place is located by where it is rather than by how its
  name is spelled, offline and for the device position too. A level is always a word and a
  glyph before it is a colour.
- **Alerts** — four ready-made switches that say exactly what they send and when, then your
  own: five templates, and a builder that is a sentence of tappable chips. Values are picked
  and never typed, so an alert cannot be written wrong. **Try it now** runs a rule against the
  forecast already on the phone and says what it would have done, posting nothing. Your
  message is your content: never rewritten, never translated.
- **Journal** — every update is already a row in the database, read back as prose and grouped
  by day: forecast revisions with their numbers, alerts that fired, sky moments observed, and
  updates that failed with their reason in plain language. Under it the forecast drift strip,
  built entirely from data already on disk.
- **Places** — a horizontal pager between saved places, with search as you type, recent
  searches, reorder, and swipe to remove with an undo. Location is coarse only and optional,
  never taken in the background.
- **Five home-screen widgets** in Glance — Now, Today, In words, Sky and The day's arc, the
  last resizing from one cell to sixteen. Each configured on its own, reading the same
  builders the app reads, so the home screen and the app cannot print two different sunrises.
- **First run** — one screen and two answers, and the location permission asked only after
  the sentence explaining why. Then the notification question, put in words before the system
  puts it in a dialog. Skipping is allowed and lands on a real "no place yet" state.
- **The guide** — a tour of the four screens in both languages, teaching with the app's own
  components. It never explains a control: a control that needs explaining is a bug here.
- **Appearance** — two palettes (Paper and Vivid), three typefaces (Google Sans, Inter, the
  phone's own), two weather-icon families drawn from Meteocons v3 by a tool rather than by
  hand, animated unless the phone asks for less motion, in light, dark or whatever the system
  is doing.
- **Offline, honestly** — the last successful report per place is kept with no TTL, so the app
  is never blank. Hours that have already happened are dropped, stale data states its real
  age, and there is no full-screen spinner in this product.
- **Battery as a feature** — one shared periodic job carries the fetch, the alerts, the rules
  and the sky observation. No foreground service, no background location, no push service.
- **Italian and English** through the system per-app language picker. Everything Chiaro
  renders is prose or data, so everything localizes, notifications and widgets included.

### Deliberately not in 1.0.0

Radar and satellite imagery (the provider has none, and that is a stated position rather than
a gap to hide), tides, aurora, air-quality forecasting beyond the current index, Wear OS,
sharing, and a second provider.

### The full record

Chiaro reached 1.0.0 with no release before it, so the entry-by-entry development history is
long enough to be its own document: it is in
[docs/CHANGELOG-1.0.0.md](https://github.com/fiorenzobrioni/chiaro/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG-1.0.0.md).
