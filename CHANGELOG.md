# Changelog

All notable changes to Chiaro are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

`release.yml` reads the section whose heading matches the tag being pushed and uses it
as the body of the GitHub Release, so a version's entry is written **before** its tag.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing released yet. The engines are in and verified, the design system is code, and
the first screen — Today — is built. See `PLANNING.md` for where the work actually is.

### Added

- The project: Gradle skeleton with `:app`, `:core:domain` (pure Kotlin/JVM) and
  `:core:data`, CI that runs every module's tests and lint before any APK, the shared
  debug keystore and the release signing config behind the four `CHIARO_KEYSTORE*`
  properties.
- The engines, copied from tweather with their test suite: the Open-Meteo client and
  mapper, the Room history, the alert engine, the rules engine and the whole astronomy
  module. `UPSTREAM.md` records the commit they came from and how to reproduce the copy.
- The design system in Compose: a generated Material color scheme from three source hues,
  the semantic tokens Material has no slot for (verdicts, a rain ramp, a diverging
  temperature ramp anchored at 15 °C), the computed sky canvas and its scrim contract,
  the daylight ribbon, Inter as a bundled variable font, and the first components.
- Four tests that hold the design document to the code: `PaletteContrastTest`,
  `ScrimContractTest`, `SkyPaletteTest`, `NoRawColorTest`.
- The Today screen: the computed sky canvas over the active place, the headline sentence
  (built on the alert engine's own thresholds, and absent when there is nothing to say),
  the next 24 hours with a rain sparkline, the merged rest-of-day timeline (sun, moon and
  rain turns), the week on one shared temperature scale with each day's ribbon of light,
  and a details grid where every number carries its one-line meaning. Cached content
  renders before any network is asked; stale data states its age; a report past its
  horizon is an empty state, never an old screen posing as current.
- The weather icons: Meteocons v2.0.0 (MIT), imported as vector drawables by
  `tools/import_meteocons.py` with the palette re-anchored so every stroke clears 3:1 on
  both surfaces — measured in the tool, re-measured by `IconContrastTest` on every build.
  `material-icons-extended` is gone (the debug APK drops from 64 to 33 MB).
- The minimal Places sheet: search-as-you-type against Open-Meteo geocoding, tap to add
  and select, the saved list to switch — the piece of Fase 3 a cityless fresh install
  cannot exist without.
